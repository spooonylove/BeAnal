## 1. Configurability. 
    - runtime configuration via secondary window
    - make sure the audio is displayed in usable, smart format. AKA, lineaer distribution of bars across frequency, etc. 
    - be able to configure the number of bars displayed across frequency
    - adding in some sort of smart automatic gain control or compression into the magnitude across the frequency, so that the information shown isn't too small
    - add segments up the bar rectangles, replicating LEDs or other dot-style representations
    - color gradients for the bars, vertically
## 2. Code organziation
    - Am I currenlty organizing this code "the right way"?  the answer could be yes, but i feel like code is often separated by function more than i'm currently set up.
    - Can I abstract out the code in a way to make it easier to implement changes?
## 3. Advanced Window configs
    - strip the border
    - transparency options
    - run-time configurable always-on-top
    - mouse hover-over makes the app briefly minimize (so it doesn't interfere with items below)
