## 1. Configurability. 
- [ ] add segments up the bar rectangles, replicating LEDs or other dot-style representations, user adjustable
- [ ] Settings saved each time executed
## 2. Code methodolgy
- [ ] Can I abstract out the code in a way to make it easier to implement changes?
- [ ] Investigate rastered solution vice WPF
## 3. Advanced configs
- [ ] transparency options inside the canvas
- [ ] mouse hover-over makes the app briefly minimize (so it doesn't interfere with items below)
